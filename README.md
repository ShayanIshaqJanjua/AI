# AI
## What is this repository about?
This repository was created for the purpose of storing prjects created during the 4 week optional Ai module at the City Computer Science Society. This module goes specifically into Machine Learning and Deep Learning, creating projects that will be based on topics such as K random means and SVMs.
## How this repository is organised.
This repository is organised into weeks, where the projects I have completed for each week are kept in folders aptly named "Week 1", "Week 2", "Week 3" and "Week 4". Additionally, there is a folder called "Extra" which will contain projects I have decided to do on my own outside of the specific module projects which expand on the topics being covered in the lectures.
## Languages and Technologies used
Every project is coded solely in Python with these technologies: Numpy, Matplotlib, SciKit-learn, TensorFlow, Pandas
